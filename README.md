# Agentic Systems

🚀 **Agentic Systems** is a go-to repository for building web search agents and multi-agent workflows using cutting-edge AI frameworks. It provides practical implementations leveraging **LangChain, LangGraph, Phidata/Agno, Pydantic, and CrewAI** to create intelligent, autonomous, and collaborative AI agents.

## 📌 Features

- **Web Search Agents** – Build AI-powered agents that autonomously retrieve and process information from the web.
- **Multi-Agent Email Response Agent** – Automates email handling with intelligent agent collaboration.
- **LLaMA OCR** – Optical Character Recognition (OCR) powered by LLaMA models for document processing.
- **Multi-Agent Travel Planner** – AI-driven travel planning, including itinerary recommendations and booking assistance.
- **Seamless Integration** – Works with popular AI frameworks to streamline agent-based solutions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **[LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)** – Framework for building LLM-powered applications.
- **[LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)** – Graph-based execution for multi-agent workflows.
- **[Phidata/Agno](https://github.com/phidata-dev/agno)** – Data and workflow automation for AI agents.
- **[Pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic)** – Data validation and settings management.
