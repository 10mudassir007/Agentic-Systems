Siamese networks provide an elegant solution to tackle similarity learning tasks. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll look into Siamese networks, exploring their architecture, building Siamese network with TensorFlow’s Functional API, and step-by-step implementation.Siamese twins painted by Henri Matisse, Dall-EUnderstanding Siamese NetworksSiamese networks, named after the iconic “Siamese twins,” are designed to process pairs of input samples, aiming to determine their degree of similarity. The architecture involves twin networks that share weights, enabling the network to extract essential features from the input data while capturing their underlying relationships. The core objective is to transform input pairs into feature representations that can be easily compared.One of the pivotal elements of Siamese networks is the contrastive loss function. This loss function drives the learning process by pushing similar samples together in the feature space while pushing dissimilar samples apart.By optimising this loss, Siamese networks master the art of understanding and quantifying similarity, making them valuable assets in various domains.TensorFlow’s Functional API: Advantages and BasicsTensorFlow’s Functional API is a powerful tool for constructing intricate neural architectures. Unlike the Sequential API, which is suitable for simple linear stacks of layers, the Functional API allows for more flexibility and creativity. With the Functional API, you can design models with multiple inputs and outputs, catering to complex\n",
            "\n",
            "requirements.At its core, the Functional API operates on the idea of building models as graphs of layers. Each layer acts as a building block, and you can easily create models by connecting layers to define the flow of data. This API is particularly well-suited for Siamese networks, where twin networks share layers and weights, demanding a more intricate structure.In the upcoming sections, we will dive into the practical implementation of Siamese networks using TensorFlow’s Functional API. We will cover everything from architecture construction to loss function definition and model training.Building a Siamese Network using TensorFlow’s Functional API1. Importing Libraries and Preparing DataWhen working with a Siamese network, your dataset should be organized into pairs, each labeled as similar or dissimilar. For instance, if you’re working with image data, you might have directories containing subdirectories for each class. You can then generate pairs of images, along with their labels (0 for similar, 1 for dissimilar), and preprocess the images (resizing, normalization, etc.).2. Constructing the Siamese ArchitectureIn this step, you’ll use the Functional API to build the Siamese architecture. Thanks to the Functional API you won’t need to duplicate the base network to create two identical subnetworks, instead you can use the same base network and pass the inputs separately.import tensorflow as tffrom tensorflow.keras.models import Modelfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Flatten, Dense, Dropout, Lambdadef initialize_base_network(): input = Input(shape=(28,28,), name=\"base_input\") x = Flatten(name=\"flatten_input\")(input) x = Dense(128, activation=’relu’, name=\"first_base_dense\")(x) x = Dropout(0.1, name=\"first_dropout\")(x) x = Dense(128, activation=’relu’, name=\"second_base_dense\")(x) x = Dropout(0.1, name=\"second_dropout\")(x) x = Dense(128, activation=’relu’, name=\"third_base_dense\")(x) return Model(inputs=input, outputs=x)def euclidean_distance(vects): x,\u001b[00m\n",
